## Restore dependencies

If you’re `VS 2017`, it will auto-restore the dependencies once the file is saved, otherwise navigate to `Server` folder run `dotnet restore`.

## Development server

Navigate to `Server` folder. Run `dotnet watch run` for a dev server. Server listening on:  `http://localhost:55551`. The `server` will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. But `client` needs manual refresh.

## Build

Navigate to `Server` folder. Run `dotnet build` to the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries.

## Release

Navigate to `Server` folder. Run `dotnet run --configuration Release` to the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries. The build artifacts will be stored in the `wwwroot/` directory for `client` and in the `bin/Debug/` for `Server`.

## Hosting environment

Set Development `setx ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT "Development"`
Set Production `setx ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT "Production"`
