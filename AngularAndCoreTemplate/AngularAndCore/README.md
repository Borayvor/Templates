## Restore dependencies

If youâ€™re `VS 2017`, it will auto-restore the dependencies once the file is saved, otherwise run `dotnet restore`.

## Development server

Run `dotnet watch run` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. The `server` will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. But `client` needs manual refresh.

## Build

Run `dotnet build` to the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries. The build artifacts will be stored in the `wwwroot/` directory for `client` and in the `bin/Debug/` for `Server`.
